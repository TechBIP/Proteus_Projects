The Wheatstone Bridge is a precision circuit used to measure electrical resistance. Comprising four resistors in a diamond shape, it achieves balance when the ratio of resistances in one arm equals the ratio in the opposite arm. This experiment is vital for accurate resistance measurements in laboratories, offering a calibrated and precise method.

### 2. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Experiment

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique widely used in electronics for controlling the power delivered to devices. This section explores the theory and applications of PWM through experiments conducted using Proteas software.

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a modulation technique where the width of pulses in a signal is varied while maintaining a constant frequency. In electronics, PWM is widely used for controlling the power delivered to devices. By adjusting the duty cycle of the pulse, the average power supplied to the load can be regulated. PWM finds applications in motor speed control, LED dimming, and various other scenarios requiring efficient power management. This experiment explores the principles and applications of PWM, showcasing its versatility in electronics.
